      <h1>What Is .dev to Us?</h1>
      <h2>Open Development</h2>
      <p>- To Actively share as much as we can all the time to as many people as we can about our development process</p>
      <p>- To Actively listen to the community and learn as much as we can but always to give back whenever we can</p>
      <h3>What This Means?</h3>
      <p>- Opening up the elements we build so that anyone can use them</p>
      <p>- Build and share our Development Platforms</p>
      <p>- To maintain Open Elements a directory and Polymer library</p>
      <p>- Record via blog, social media and much more our processes, challenges and successes</p>
      <p>- Host and speak at as many events about Polymer and Firebase sharing our experiences</p>
      <p>- Teach students the new library and framework</p>
      <h3>Why Do This?</h3>
      <p>This started from a volunteer project working alongside and supporting the most vulnerable. You can read our story here. We want to give back what our startup is building in every way we can. Even in the development process. We would not have this opportunity, be in this position without the kindness of strangers and our willingness to help others. Because of this we want to continue that process. We understand that as a private company we cannot share everything and ensure, prioritise that the core business works but that doesn’t mean we can’t still commit to our community at the highest level possible.</p>
