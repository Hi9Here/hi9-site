      <p>Hi9 is currently developing a product that will reimagine the way we use the web; truly make it simple. Introducing deko.</p>
      <p>deko not only organises weblinks, it also allows them to be shared. Users save their favourite weblinks as cards which can be grouped into decks to keep &/or share with friends, family or work colleagues. So, whether as an individual, family or even organisation, deko makes being online simple & streamlined.</p>

      <p>For organisations we also offer a bespoke admin. panel which enables you to select & create cards & decks for your users. You can also use the admin. panel for communications - to share information about events in the community, news within your organisation etc. It also allows you to generate analytics, send out surveys, post reminders, in fact pretty much anything you want.</p>
