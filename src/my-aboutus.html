      <h1>About HI9</h1>
      <p>We’re a rapidly growing tech startup based in beautiful Cornwall.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2014, Wo and Kate’s mission was simple; to provide affordable/free computers to those that needed them the most. This was the catalyst to them setting up HI9: a digital services company that strives to get those on low income, disabled, vulnerable and socially excluded online and included. Then came the next challenge; to enable these people to make full use of all the internet has to offer. This is where deko came along. </p>
      <p>What Wo and Kate realised, while working on HI9, was that once connected to the internet, people wanted to connect and share useful information with those they cared about, easily and quickly. deko helps them do just that. Now, parents can share decks of useful educational links to their children. Busy adults can share decks of useful banking and shopping links with their elderly parents. Firms can share decks of work related links with their employees to boost employees. The possibilities are endless. </p>
