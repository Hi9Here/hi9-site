					<h2>Our Mission, Our Inspirations, Our History</h2>
					
					<p>Hi9's a rapid growth tech startup based in beautiful Cornwall.</p>
					<p>Founded in 2014, our company's mission is simple; to provide affordable technologies directly or via an organisation
						to those that need them the most whether on low income, disabled, vulnerable or socially excluded.</p>
					<p>We're proud to say our ideas earned us a place on the Google Launchpad programme which continues to help and support
						us on our journey.</p>
					<p>Not long into the project we discovered another challenge - the need to make the web simple to use.</p>
					<p>Our idea? To create a software solution to do just that. A platform that organises websites displays them as cards that
						can be grouped into decks & shared with friends, family & colleagues.</p>
					<p>So we began to develop deko.</p>
					<p>Deko's development is ongoing & is an added extra to our digital packages or offered as a standalone product.</p>
					<p>Find out all about our current products & services plus what's coming next!</p>
					<p>Keep up to date with developments & be one of the first to sign up for deko, our software solution that makes the web
						simple.</p>
