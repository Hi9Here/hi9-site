          <p>Don’t want to be your parents tech support anymore? Fed-up looking over your kids shoulder? Then here’s what to do.</p>
        <p>Hi9 hardware is super secure & super simple to set up plus it’s affordable. The Chromebook laptop is browser only, so no nasty updates, no security programmes; it’s all done for you. It also has voice activation, great for the elderly or visually impaired & fab for the young ones. All our pacakages come with super-friendly telephone & online customer support.</p>
        <p>But it doesn’t stop there.<p/>
        <p>Hi9 has developed deko - a platform that can organise all your family’s favourite sites, present them simply on cards which can be grouped into decks to create a shareable library. This allows parents to choose only suitable sites for their kids which keeps them safe, and for an elderly relative they can curate the web so there are no more confusing searches & a reduction to online fraud.</P>
