      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>Hi9’s a small tech. start up based in Penzance, tucked in between the fairytale island of St Michael’s Mount and Lands End, the furthest westerly point in the UK. In some ways it’s the perfect position, in others it’s extremely difficult especially when it comes to business. And just like life, business never seems to work out quite the way you expect….</p>
      <p>This is our story; our journey to build a new, unique company.</p>
      <p>Back in 2014, I made a decision that unknowingly would take me down a whole new road. I elected to put my skills and free time to good use by volunteering to help at a Hackspace in Penzance – OpenShed. It was here that I first met with Marcus Hitchins, one of its founders, who would continue on to be our developer at Hi9.</p>
      <p>OpenShed was all about salvaging and rebuilding unused computers mainly donated by SME’s and schools. This recycling of equipment wherever possible made a much better alternative to simply dumping hardware.</p>
      <p>More importantly, with a minimal amount of fixing and updating, the computers could then be reallocated within the community. Everyone locally of all ages and all backgrounds were invited to join a Build Your Own Computer course. For just £20 you learnt how to put together a basic desktop, some online skills plus walk away with your own computer come end of day!</p>
      <p>It was during this time that it became obvious that a lot of people on benefits were attending – desperate for a computer. In fact due to change in government legislation, being online had become a necessity in order to receive benefits. Add to that the basic right to essential online services and education platforms both of which could be pivotal tools in getting back to work or assisting the disabled, all these possibilities were being overlooked.</p>
      <p>It’s blindingly obvious that people within this demographic have low to no spare disposable income so without disrupting this cycle and providing affordable online access, the no-win scenario will just roll on and on.</p>
      <p>Having observed the stupidity of the situation myself, Marcus, Kate along with other members of the Hackspace made it our mantra that everyone should have online access, with no exclusions, no excuses.</p>  
      <p>At this point it’s important I make something clear….you need to understand Cornish culture; everyone and I mean everyone in Cornwall knows what everyone else is doing all the time, so trying to keep anything private is just not possible.</p>
      <p>So, when a Mr Tim Wotton happened to pop his head round to door out of curiosity, to find out exactly what was going on at OpenShed we weren’t altogether surprised!</p>
      <p>Tim is the Partnership, Engagement and Initiatives Officer for DCH – Devon & Cornwall Housing and he was excited by the possibilities of Build Your Own Computer, how it had the potential to help his residents.</p>
      <p>After a series of conversations we all decided as a team to put it to test. Tim arranged for us to meet with 10 DCH residents living in St Ives and to set each of them up with their own recycled desktop. Marcus, Ian and myself forked a Linux OS, removed the hard drives and replaced them instead with pen drives – simple and cost effective.</p>
      <p>To make things not just cheap but also usable especially for people with no online experience, we put up a series of simple, direct links making the interface as user friendly as possible and removing the often overpowering function of search.</p>
      <p>The outcome? Excited users and success stories. It’s amazing what you can do with low to no budget and a bit of adaptability.</p>
      <p>The next stage happened pretty much immediately. Tim gave us a challenge. How would we go about getting the socially disadvantaged online with a maximum budget of £250.</p>
      <p>What could I do? No one would say no to a challenge like that would they? Well our solution was this. Provide a digital bundle consisting of a Chromebook, MIFI and data card with 6 months connectivity, along with telephone support but most importantly, an easy platform providing fast solutions via direct links.</p>
      <p>At the same time an admin. section was set up for the housing association. This would done to prove that the system worked, and that people were going online so benefiting from having the kit. This admin. section also had the capability to generate surveys questions, produce reports and analytics – in fact the possibilities were unending.</p>
      <p>Having gained so much momentum myself, Marcus and Kate decided to form a start up to investigate this more, see if this really was viable and if so on what scale. I approached Google who were keen to help and not only put us in touch with Chromebook manufactures but also added us to their launchpad program.</p>
      <p>This helped exponentially when it came to meetings and support. Falmouth University were also fantastic giving us facilities, support and advice on the best way to put together the package along with space to brain storm further ideas and solutions.</p>
      <p>Only a few weeks later our first 10 packages went out to residents of DCH. Shortly after that another Housing Association, the Yarlington joined up and ordered 20. And so we came to have our pilot project!</p>
      <p>With things moving forward successfully I made the decision to make the project an investment, a company making profit, rather than a charity. I was convinced that this increased the likelihood of delivering the solution fast and effectively plus having a much greater overall reach.</p>
      <p>If we could demonstrate to institutions that they would achieve an ROI in a multitude of ways very quickly then it made sense that they would support and push for all their residents to have a package.</p>
      <p>Taking it one step further, if the Department of Work and Pensions realised that they could not only get their money back but also significantly reduce outgoings, the potential was overwhelming. And because of this it reconfirmed to me that the company had to be for profit.</p>
      <p>But as ever, a theory needs to be tested and Penzance Job Centre was kind enough to provide the perfect place to do just that.</p>
      <p>I spent a day meeting job seekers, listening to some amazing stories – people telling me again and again how they were being forced to spend what little money they had on transport to and from remote rural locations to the JC, waiting for possible 30mins slots in the library just to login and register. There was certainly low to no spare time for job searching let alone further education.</p>
      <p>You have to understand that in rural locations especially, public transport is striped to the bare minimum. For example where I live the journey to Penzance, only 6 miles away costs over £6 return and there are only 2 buses a day. So what do you do while you’re waiting for that return bus? You have no money for coffee let alone lunch. What about if it’s raining, where do you go?</p>
      <p>It begs the question is this really the best we can do? Do we really think this is the way to get people back to work?</p>
      <p>Everyone I spoke with without exception all agreed that having one of these packages could make all the difference for all the obvious reasons – job searching, learning new skills, social inclusion, services, health and well being, the list goes on and on.</p>
      <p>Theory tested, it was now down to the technology.</p>
      <p>And a solution appeared  just at the right time – Polymer.</p>
      <p>Marcus and I first fell in love with Polymer 0.5 at the Google I/O. We both agreed that this could be the way of developing in the future and because of that we formed GDG Cornwall. A year later with loads of help from Google we hosted a Google I/O extended at Falmouth University. We were thrilled to welcome 70 people in through the doors and many more online.</p>
      <p>By then Polymer 1.o had launched and it reconfirmed to us that this was the code we were going to use for Hi9. The benefits? Speedy development and perfect offline first (important for people with inconsistent connections).</p>
      <p>Our enthusiasm spilled out into spreading the word, hosting Polymer workshops with other devs. and students. In fact as the community grew we decided to start dev. – a place to share everything we knew with everyone out there. We were and remain committed to open source and to share all our development processes in the hope it will help others.</p>
      <p>This how our programming started out and this is the way we’ll continue to build our product.</p>
      <p>To gain more backing we began to lobby local MP’s, companies, funding bodies and of course, Google – anyone who could help. We calculated that there was at least 20,000 deprived people in Cornwall; with a budget of £250 per person that calculated out at 5M.  5M would have everyone up and running, all at a cost to organisations which would be rapidly recovered.</p>
      <p>Then I started to re-evaluate the maths. With scaling on board you could get that spend even lower, down to £200. So how about 500,000 people? That would cover a high percentage of the country. It would mean that every unemployed person or anyone on benefits would be online and able to access services, job search, learn skills, keep in touch and much, much more.  All this accomplished for 100M.</p>
      <p>Then the final piece of the jigsaw slipped into place.</p>
      <p>People in the pilot project started to use the web app we built and loved it. Not only that, we found that more often than not there were multiple users in households – something we’d never even thought of.  The app was proving useful in itself, a standalone product. It was because of just this that we decided to sell hi9 the app separately. And so the build began!</p>
      <p>We had a startup; a proven pilot project, oorganisationing feedback from administrators and users, a product and a team I had cobbled together who all believed in the dream – to build a company and to help everyone and anyone organise and use technology to find solutions.</p>
      <p>We are now entering the next stage. Beta. with 1000s of users provided by the Housing Associations that will be using the app with a mix of Chromebook, MIFIs, line connections and of course super friendly customer support.</p>
      <p>To find out if we make it follow us on… We might just. and we hope you can help, share the journey.</p>
