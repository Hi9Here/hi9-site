      <h1>NGO</h1>
      <p>As an NGO, your job is to care for & to create opportunities for your customers. Hi9’s job is to make that process simpler.</p>
<p>Being digitally included is now a priority but sadly the most in need, those on low income, the elderly, disabled & vulnerable, are not connected. Our mission is to provide all NGO’s with cost effective, intelligent solutions not only when it comes to hardware but also software.</p>
<p>Our current digital bundles include a 11” or 14” Chromebook, a MiFi with Data SIM & an optional Yubikey for that extra bit of security. Each of these items have been carefully selected to make getting connected as easy as possible.</p>
The Chromebook is browser only, no updates, no security programmes to worry about plus there are other added extras like voice activation, ideal for anyone with poor eyesight or an inability to type. The MiFi & Data SIM means the user can keep control of costs - no contract, no unexpected bills, while the Yubikey ramps up security + offers a one password option.</p>
<p>When it comes to software - Hi9 is developing a product that will reimagine the way we use the web; truly making it simple - deko.</p>
<p>deko not only organises weblinks, it also allows them to be shared. For an NGO, we offer an admin. panel which enables you to select & create cards & decks for your users. Add to that you can share information say about events in the community, news within your organisation along with sending out surveys, posting reminders, receiving analytics, in fact pretty much anything you want.</p>
